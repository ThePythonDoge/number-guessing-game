# Number Guessing Game
A simple program written in [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/), it allows the user to play a very bare-bones guessing game. It has no UI, and I created it as a way to test my current knowledge. 
You are welcome to use it however you like, I don't really care, in the end it's only a test.
